**Real-Time Gaze Detection Using OpenCV and dlib**
This project implements a real-time gaze detection application using Python, OpenCV, and dlib. The application captures video from a webcam, detects facial landmarks, and determines the gaze direction (focused or not focused). The dlib library is used for face detection and facial landmark identification, while OpenCV handles video capture and image processing
